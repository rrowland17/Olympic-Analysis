## Project Description

This project aims to create an interactive web application that showcases how the have the Olympics games have changed over 120 years. 

Our app can be accessed at: https://olympic-medalists.herokuapp.com/

## Data Source:

``` 
## Description:
The dataset we found contains every male and female participant information that has competed in the Summer and Winter Olympic games since Athens 1896 up until Rio 2016. The data set is composed of two CSV files, one containing the athletes information (such as sex, age, event, year, and if they medaled) and the second containing the NOC (National Olympic Committee 3 letter code) and the country name. 

We chose this dataset because the raw looked clean and could provide many unique visualizations. We would like to show how the Olympics has changed over time, including the countries that win the most medals, and how the average dimensions of the Olympic athlete has changed over time.
